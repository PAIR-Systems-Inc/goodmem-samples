ACME API Documentation

INTRODUCTION
The ACME REST API provides programmatic access to our core services. This documentation covers authentication, endpoints, and integration patterns for developers.

AUTHENTICATION
All API requests require authentication using API keys. Include your API key in the request header:

Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY

API keys can be generated from your account dashboard. Keep your API keys secure and do not share them publicly.

BASE URL
All API endpoints are accessed via:
https://api.acme.com/v1/

RATE LIMITING
API requests are limited to:
- 1000 requests per hour for free accounts
- 10000 requests per hour for premium accounts
- Rate limit headers are included in all responses
